# Description: This calculator will take the user's input, their yield, price, and government payment, variable cost,
# and their overhead cost per acre and provide them with a report that gives them the following information. The total
# revenue, the total cost, the earnings, the break even price, per bushel profit, per acre. It also outputs in the
# report, the difference in case of 10% decrease in yield, 10% increase in yield, 10% decrease in costs, and 10%
# increase in cost.
